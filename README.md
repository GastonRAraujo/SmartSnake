# SmartSnake

SmartSnake and SmartSnakeV1 are the classical snake game but they can be played by a Neural Network. The idea is that you can make your own modifications to the code, and if you have some QUESTIONS, plz ask me (gastonraraujo@gmail.com)

In the following files, you will find the Jupyter Notebook code for the game, the AI version, and some versions of the parameters of a trained NN.



“SmartSnake” is the HUMAN played version

“SmartSnake_V1” is the non-HUMAN played version.



Perhaps in the future I will add a new version with a genetic algorithm, and I’m plaining to combine the two games with a user-friendly menu.
