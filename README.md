# SmartSnake

SmartSnake and SmartSnakeV1 are the classical snake game but they can be played by a Neural Network. 
The idea is that you can make your own modifications to the code and if you have some QUESTIONS plz ask me (gastonraraujo@gmail.com)

In the following files you would find the Jupyter Notebook code for the game,
the AI version and some versions of the parameters of a trained NN.

SmartSnake is the HUMAN played version
SmartSnake_V1 is the non-HUMAN played version

May be in the future i add a new version with genetic algorithm and 
im plaining to combine the two games with a User friendly menu.
